inputs: none
outputs: 28 component vector of log10 viral loads 

(Make four random draws)

t3 = random draw from U(0,1) + 2.5
tp = t3 + random draw from Gamma(1.5) + .5
while tp > 3:
    tp = t3 + random draw from Gamma(1.5) + .5
t6 = t3 + tp + random draw from U(4,9)
yp = random draw from U(7,11)

v = vector of length 28
for t from 1 to 28:
    v[t] = ViralLoadFunction(t, t3, tp, t6, yp)

return v
