Pseudocode for calculating the reduction factor of the basic reproduction
rate R.

Calculates the reduction in R for a specific testing policy

Explanation of Inputs:

D = testing interval in days
L = limit of detection in log10 of chosen test
inf = infectiousness function (logproportional, threshold, proportional)
asymptomatic = proportion of infections that have none or mild symptoms
dt = turnaround time for test results
cutoff = viral load needed to be infectious
n_samples = just number of iterations to run
se = proportion of tests that will function correctly

---------------

Inputs: D, L, inf, asymptomatic, dt, cutoff, n_samples, se
Outputs: scalar value in (0,1] for the reduction in infectiousness

pol, no_pol = 0, 0
for i in 1:n_samples
    #a = infectiousness removed via testing, b = from self-isolation, c = total
    a, b, c = infectiousness_removed_indiv(D, L, inf, asymptomatic, dt, cutoff, se)
    no_pol = no_pol + (c-b)
    pol = pol + (c - (b+a))
    return (pol/no_pol)
    

-> infectiousness_removed_indiv(...) just a decision fork
to a symptomatic or asymptomatic sub-function ->

#Here is the call to the asymptomatic branch

    V = randomly generate 28 day list for viral trajectory (asymptomatic).
    I = Infectiousness score list corresponding to values in V.
    total = sum(I)
